# The following action icons are hardcoded in Django source code (CSS):
#
#    - '../img/icon-viewlink.svg'
#    - '../img/icon-addlink.svg'
#    - '../img/icon-changelink.svg'
#    - '../img/icon-deletelink.svg'
#    - etc
#
# And when sending requests to '/<ADMIN_URL>/<APP>/<MODEL>/', Safari makes
# request to the following URLS '/<ADMIN_URL>/<MODEL>/img/icon-.*.svg'
# due to relative nature of icons links.
