You're looking at the source code of `my brand-spanking new blog <https://serghei.blog/?utm_source=github.com&utm_campaign=banch_readme&utm_medium=smm>`_.
One day I decided that instead of using a ready-made blogging solution, I could
create my own that meets my personal needs. I named it **Branch**. Its main goal
is to help me take notes and keep thoughts in one place.
